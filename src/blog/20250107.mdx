# History and Origins

The Japanese tea ceremony, known as "Chanoyu" or "Sado," has deep cultural roots.

## Ancient Beginnings

Tea was first introduced to Japan from China during the Nara period.

### The Zen Connection

Buddhist monks used tea to stay awake during meditation sessions.

> "Tea is nothing other than this:
> Heat the water, prepare the tea, and drink it with propriety.
> That is all you need to know."
>
> — **Sen no Rikyū**
```

### Evolution of Practice

The ceremony evolved from simple tea drinking to a refined spiritual practice.

## The Four Principles

The tea ceremony embodies four essential principles known as "Wa-Kei-Sei-Jaku."

### Harmony (Wa)

Harmony exists between people, nature, and the tea utensils.

#### With Nature

The tea room design reflects the changing seasons.

```yaml
seasons:
  spring: Cherry blossom scrolls
  summer: Cooling blue ceramics
  autumn: Maple leaf motifs
  winter: Warm red tea bowls
```

#### With Guests

Creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding.

### Respect (Kei)

Showing reverence for all things, both living and inanimate.

## Essential Utensils

Each tool in the tea ceremony has specific purpose and meaning.

### The Tea Bowl (Chawan)

The most important vessel, chosen to reflect the season and occasion.

    { "type": "Seto", "description": "Glazed ceramic ware" },
    { "type": "Oribe", "description": "Green and white designs" }
  ]
}
```

### The Tea Whisk (Chasen)

Used to blend the matcha powder with water into a frothy consistency.

# The Ceremony Process

A traditional tea ceremony follows a precise sequence of movements.

## Preparation Phase

The host carefully prepares the tea room and utensils before guests arrive.

### Cleaning Ritual

Each utensil is ritually cleansed in the presence of guests.

```bash
# Cleansing Order
echo "1. Natsume (tea caddy)"
echo "2. Chashaku (tea scoop)"
echo "3. Chasen (tea whisk)"
echo "4. Chawan (tea bowl)"
```

### Water Temperature

The water must be heated to the perfect temperature for matcha.

```python
# Water temperature guidelines
IDEAL_TEMP_MIN = 70  # °C
IDEAL_TEMP_MAX = 80  # °C

def check_temperature(temp):
    if temp > IDEAL_TEMP_MAX:
        return "Too hot: Bitter taste"
    elif temp < IDEAL_TEMP_MIN:
        return "Too cold: Powder won't dissolve properly"
    else:
        return "Perfect temperature for matcha"
```

## Guest Etiquette

Proper behavior as a guest is essential to the ceremony's harmony.

### Entering the Tea Room

Guests enter through a small door, requiring them to bow in humility.

### Receiving Tea

The bowl is received with both hands and rotated before drinking.

```ruby
class TeaCeremony
  def receive_tea
    steps = [
      "Bow to host in gratitude",
      "Place bowl on left palm",
      "Support with right hand",
      "Rotate bowl clockwise twice",
      "Drink in three sips",
      "Wipe rim with right hand",
      "Rotate counter-clockwise",
      "Return to host"
    ]

    steps.each_with_index do |step, index|
      puts "#{index + 1}. #{step}"
    end
  end
end
```

### Appreciating Beauty

Taking time to admire the tea bowl and surrounding aesthetics.

# Modern Tea Ceremony

While maintaining tradition, contemporary practitioners adapt to modern life.

## Tea Schools

Several schools preserve and teach different styles of tea ceremony.

### Urasenke School

The most widely practiced school, emphasizing accessibility and warmth.

### Omotesenke School

Focuses on formal procedures and traditional aesthetics.

## Learning the Way

Mastering the tea ceremony is a lifelong journey of refinement and spiritual growth.

This ancient practice continues to offer peace and mindfulness in our fast-paced world.
