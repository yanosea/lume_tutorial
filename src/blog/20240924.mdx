# Chasing Light in Darkness

Night photography opened my eyes to a completely different world that exists after sunset.

## Essential Equipment

You don't need expensive gear to start:

```
My Simple Setup:
- Basic DSLR or mirrorless camera
- Sturdy tripod for stability
- Remote shutter release
- Headlamp with red filter
```

## Favorite Subjects

```
Night Photography Targets:
- Star trails over familiar landscapes
- City lights reflected in water
- The moon rising through trees
- Light painting with flashlights
```

The quiet solitude of night photography creates a meditative experience.
