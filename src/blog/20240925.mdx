# Tea as Meditation

In a world that moves too fast, tea reminds us to slow down and savor the moment.

## My Tea Collection

- Earl Grey for contemplative afternoons
- Green tea for gentle morning energy
- Chamomile for peaceful evenings
- Oolong for special occasions

Each cup tells a story and creates a moment of mindful pause in the day.
