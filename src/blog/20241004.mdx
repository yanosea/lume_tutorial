# 1000 Pieces of Zen

What started as a rainy afternoon activity has become my go-to method for clearing my mind and finding inner peace.

## The Perfect Setup

```
My Puzzle Station:
- Well-lit corner by the window
- Comfortable chair with good back support
- Small bowls for sorting pieces
- Gentle background music or podcast
```

## Strategy That Works

- Start with edge pieces (obviously)
- Sort by color and pattern
- Work on small sections simultaneously
- Take breaks to avoid frustration

There's something deeply satisfying about watching chaos slowly transform into a complete picture.
