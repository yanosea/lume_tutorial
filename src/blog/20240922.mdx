# Painting with Light and Water

Watercolor painting teaches patience and acceptance - sometimes the best results come from happy accidents.

## Essential Techniques

- Wet-on-wet for dreamy backgrounds
- Wet-on-dry for sharp details
- Color mixing directly on paper

The unpredictable nature of watercolor keeps every painting session full of delightful surprises.
