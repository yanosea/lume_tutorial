# Messages from the Past

Every vintage postcard tells two stories - the scene on the front and the personal message on the back.

## The Hunt

- **Antique shops**: Hidden gems in dusty boxes
- **Estate sales**: Family collections with rich histories
- **Flea markets**: Unexpected discoveries

The best postcards are the ones with handwritten messages that glimpse into someone else's life and travels.
