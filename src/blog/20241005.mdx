# The Ancient Art of Bread Making

There's something deeply satisfying about creating bread from just flour, water, yeast, and time.

## My Simple Recipe Evolution

```
Basic Bread Formula:
- 3 cups flour (I prefer a mix of white and whole wheat)
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp honey for feeding the yeast
```

## The Meditative Process

```
Bread-Making Rhythm:
- Morning: Mix and first rise (2 hours)
- Afternoon: Shape and second rise (1 hour)
- Evening: Bake and enjoy the amazing smell
```

The best part isn't just the final loaf, but the slow, mindful process that gets you there.
